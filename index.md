### Dionysus 1, 2, 3
- Interrupted "happiness" of all people who have been colonized by more organized nations with [divine ambition puff'd](https://abikesa.github.io/henryv/)
  
### O For a Muse of Fire ðŸ”¥ [4](https://abikesa.github.io/dionysus/intro.html)
- Narrative and communication here is romantic, nationalist, and panafrican. Only appeals to the weak who have no say over the "melody" of human history
- What we have is the opportunity to `reharm` this melody to smooth away dissonances and provide consonant harmonies and lullaby's
  
### Apollo 5, 6
- Timing of industrial revolution & colonization of Africa yields distinct qualities from Aztek, Native Indian, Aborigines, Chinese, Japanese
- Africa could be handed up its sovereignty but Europe's industrialization would pick African produce higher up the **value chain**
- Museveni fails to link this to his [other idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=585IMBb14Kg&t=1s) regarding African progression along: Hunter-gatherer, peasant, farmer, technology, electricity, transportation
